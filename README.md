# openup.github.io

Local development
-----------------

Install Jekyll and dependencies with

    bundle install

Then run the Jekyll server with

    bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

The site should then be running on http://localhost:4000/ and will reflect changes as you make them.

Deployment
----------

The site is served by github pages, so to deploy to production simply:

    git push
