	  <h2>We believe that access to data empowers people</h2>
	  <p>
	  	We are a community of people who believe that an integral part of building an empowered society is providing access to data and information that allows denizens to participate in democracy.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	OpenUp was started with the mission of liberating data so that people could actively engage with what is happening in society and contribute to decisions that affect their lives on a personal, local and national level. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	What we learned is that just making data available is not enough. To those who need this information the most - ordinary denizens - the data is useless if they canâ€™t find it, understand it or use it.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	So we started building tools that make the data more accessible: easy to understand, easy to share, easy to engage with. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	We believe that with access to the right and relevant information, people are empowered to participate by adding their voice, highlighting issues that affect them and finding solutions to problems.
