short: "When it comes to open data we have learnt that data just being open, available and accessible is not enough. While we don’t have all the answers, we do have some learnings to share."

## In the Beginning
In the beginning there was data and we saw that data was good and that it could be a powerful [tool](http://opendatacharter.net/principles/) for [change](http://odimpact.org/) if people have access to it and we set out to liberate high-value datasets, eager to do our bit to drive social transformation. And so the [original idea](https://blog.okfn.org/2012/08/16/the-very-first-open-data-and-democracy-initiative-hackathon-south-africa/), that was eventually to become OpenUp (formerly Code for South Africa), was born. A group of data enthusiasts got together, got their heads around the concept of [open data](https://okfn.org/opendata/) and set out to advocate for open public-interest data in South Africa. 

Fast-forward some 5 years and progress is starting to be seen, made evident by the [Cape Town Open Data Policy](https://web1.capetown.gov.za/web1/opendataportal/Images/OpenDataPolicy.pdf), the eThekwini Open Data Policy and of course by South Africa being a member of the [Open Government Partnership (OGP)](http://www.ogp.gov.za/) and [adopting open principles](http://www.cipc.co.za/files/8614/6435/1332/SITA_Open_Government_Presentation_2016_04.pdf). Why then do we not see the transformed society originally envisaged, both by ourselves some years ago, as well as the broader open data community?

## Supply and Demand
One initial theory dealt with the amount of data being released. The premise that increasing the number open data consumers would drive the supply of open data is a sound one, but one that [cannot be considered in isolation](https://ijnet.org/en/blog/why-publishing-more-open-data-isn%E2%80%99t-enough-empower-citizens). 

Yes a strong demand is needed but contextual understanding of the market is vitally important too. In a largely unequal society like South Africa’s, it would be foolish to think that everyone would have the access, the means and the ability to use open data as desired. Our society experiences low literacy and numeracy rates and whilst [data literacy](http://codebridge.org.za/2016-12-01/data-kids.htm) is definitely a necessary component in furthering this course, it doesn’t remedy the immediate situation.

## Making it Personal 
We are fortunate enough to have walked a long path with the media industry locally, having run Africa’s first brick and mortar [Data Journalism Academy](http://code4sa.org/2016/02/10/academy-launch.html) last year. We have seen firsthand the power of storytelling and its ability to evoke emotion and drive conversation. Take [Living Wage](http://livingwage.code4sa.org/) for instance. A very [simple tool](http://living-wage.co.za/) (be sure you tweak the assumptions) allows one to calculate what a living (not minimum) salary might be, however the impact of not earning a fair, living wage remains a detached, impersonal idea until one reads Primose, Justine and Nosiphiwo’s stories. Likewise the [Ndifunda Ukwazi](http://nu.org.za/) [Informal Settlement Maps](http://ismaps.org.za/desktop.html) sets out to highlight inequality of service delivery in informal settlements in Cape Town and while a user might explore the maps, click through some data and get an understanding of the lack of access to adequate sanitation, it’s only when one reads Asithandile or Zukiswe’s stories to we really get an inkling of what this means to a person.

Storytelling role in society is such a fascinating one that I intend to write an article diving into more detail on how I believe it can play an essential role in driving change and developing and enabling and empowering culture.

## To What End?
Why do we want citizens to use open data? What do expect them to do once there is that emotional attachment to the story? How is this meant to drive social change? 

We believe that evidence (data) + anecdotes (stories) result in a better chance of citizens being empowered to participate in our democracy, assert their rights and responsibilities with confidence, all backed with evidence and, with the actions of many, culminate in a more transparent and equal society.
