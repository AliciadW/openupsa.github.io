[Introduction to Data Storytelling](https://openup.org.za/img/resources/Open-Intake-Invite-Sept17.pdf): a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of data journalism as a method for practicing storytelling with data.

The learning objectives of the course are as follows:

* To provide insight into the different roles, skills and workflow that make up a data unit.
* To introduce the fundamental stages of processing data required in developing a data driven story.
* To establish a set of principles and guidelines to consider when planning and producing a data driven story through the analysis and critique of data driven stories published across the globe.
* To teach learners how to interview a dataset through a journalistic lens to mine for potential stories.
* Introduction to online resources and existing tools that leverage data to tell a different story about the society we live in.

We are excited to introduce our instructor for the 2 days:
