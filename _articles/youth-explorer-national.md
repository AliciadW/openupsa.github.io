We're excited to announce that [Youth Explorer](https://youthexplorer.org.za) has graduated from the Western Cape and now has data on youth across the whole of South Africa. Friday 16 June 2017 is [Youth Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Day), a fitting day to expand this invaluable tool to the national level, giving unprecedented access to data and statistics on South Africans aged 15 to 24.

Youth Explorer ([youthexplorer.org.za](https://youthexplorer.org.za)) is a critical tool for anyone planning for or working with youth -- those aged 15 to 24 -- in South Africa. Working together with [UCT’s Poverty and Inequality Initiative](http://www.povertyandinequality.uct.ac.za/) we've broadened the scope of Youth Explorer to include national data on demographics, education, economic opportunities, family and living environment, poverty levels, and health and wellbeing.

> “Youth-centred data at the small area - or community - level is scarce. Yet it is exactly at this level that programmes and policies need to be implemented. Too often provincial or municipal averages hide the stark differences that exist between communities.” -- Emily Frame, Research Officer, Poverty and Inequality Initiative at the University of Cape Town.

The data, taken from the [2011 national census](http://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=3839) provides deep insight into the issues facing youth today, at the national, provincial, municipality and ward levels.

## How to use Youth Explorer

If you're a municipality, government department, civil society organisation or in the private sector, Youth Explorer is an indispensible tool for policies, planning and decision-making.

To help you get started, we've published a series of [explainer videos to help you](https://youthexplorer.org.za/help) get the most out of Youth Explorer.

## The story behind the data

Youth Explorer builds on the simplicity, power and familiarity of [Wazimap.co.za](https://wazimap.co.za/) to make the rich datasets around youth in South Africa approachable, understandable and useful.

Youth Explorer was developed in partnership with [UCT’s Poverty and Inequality Initiative](http://www.povertyandinequality.uct.ac.za/), [Western Cape Government](https://www.westerncape.gov.za/), [City of Cape Town](http://www.capetown.gov.za/), [Stats SA](http://www.statssa.gov.za/) and [OpenUp](https://openup.org.za/).
