We recently ran our first open intake in Johannesburg for our [Introduction to Data Storytelling](https://openup.org.za/img/resources/OI-Invite-Update.pdf) course, one of five [courses](/courses.html) run by OpenUp in order to promote [data literacy](/themes/dataliteracy.html).

This course introduces participants to data journalism as a model for data storytelling. It focuses on defining and establishing the right combination of literacies necessary for participants to begin to talk about data. 

The course is suited to anyone, be it a beginner who is interested in adding an ability to work with data to their arsenal, or a data professional interested in effective communication. 

Data storytelling involves transforming data into a format that is relevant and meaningful to an audience. This course walks participants through:

- the philosophy behind communicating data,
- a blueprint for developing a data story,
- the skills and literacies needed for working with data for communication, and
- a full day immersive data investigation that sees participants exploring the process of storytelling with data.

In Johannesburg, participants attending the course ranged from financial investigative data analysts to journalists.  It was an exciting session, with a highly engaged group of Learners , who treated the practical exercise as a serious investigation - their ideas and the progression of the story during the course of the practical was impressive.

We would like to thank [Caxton CTP](http://caxton.co.za/), and Dejane Poil and her team, for providing a great venue.

Hereâ€™s what some of our Learners had to say about the course:

> Great initiative, very interactive, very informative session

> Collaborating with others on various ways to tell data stories was useful. Videos and examples were helpful and educational

> Thank you for a great course!

> Day two was more practical & required application of the learned skills. I enjoyed this most

> Learning how to structure a story including practical elements, and structured thinking around how to layout a good story was useful

On the 3rd and 4th of October, OpenUp will be hosting the  Cape Town intake. While the signups for this intake have closed, applications for our Durban intake have been extended til Monday 1st October. Interested?
