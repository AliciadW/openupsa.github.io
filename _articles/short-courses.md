Without a community of data consumers, or the support of data producers, open data won't become part of the national discourse.

We believe that an equal society starts with equal access to information, and to that end we promote the release of data under open data licences to make it available to everyone who wants and needs it.  To that end we are also involved in a number of data literacy programmes, with the aim of equipping South Africans with the skills, techniques, and tools that will enable them to become a community of data consumers.

One of these data literacy programmes offers training in the form of short 1 or 2 day courses.  Our curriculum covers the different (often) sequential stages of the data processing pipeline, and has recently experienced an overhaul to provide a more concentrated focus on each of the stages of the Data Pipeline.

The new structure of our curriculum provides a modular approach to the assembly of course material, allowing us to better address the unique skills of each of our learner groups, bringing more personal relevance to their learning experience.
