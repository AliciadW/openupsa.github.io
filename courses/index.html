    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Please may we have some more information about your courses?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Our courses run in one of 2two ways - either internally for organisations who have a large enough group for us to facilitate internal training, or alternatively as scheduled open intakes based on a minimum number of participants.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Are your courses only available to organisations?

      Our open intakes are open to the public based on scheduling.

    <div class="question">
      What is the cost of  internal organisational training per course?
    </div>
    <div class="anwer">
      We prefer to compile modules for internal organisational based on a consultative process with organisations to ensure that we cover content suitable to the organisation's needs.  We also provide the option to shape curriculum for internal training around an organisation's own data, to ensure the relevant skills transfer, which may entail a small additional cost.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Why isn’t your training free?
    </div>
    <div class="anwer">
      OpenUp’s Data Literacy Programme consists of 2 main endeavours:
      Firstly, through our [Codebridge] grant we fund free data literacy training for identified segments of the population i.e. youth, school children, or those who are unable to afford commercial training opportunities.
      (More content on this soon)

      We are publishing tutorials and content on basic data literacy knowledge and skills, as well as open software usage, free.  Additionally our material is shared with the [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/), with whom we collaborate on curriculum development.

      Secondly, Short Courses are facilitated at commercial rates as a profit stream that contributes to the sustainability of our  organisation, and in support of some of our other projects. Our short course curriculum will equip Learners with the skills our team has acquired through the practise and teaching of this material, as it relates to the Data Processing Pipeline.

    <div class="question">
      Why Data Literacy?
    </div>
    <div class="anwer">
      OpenUp, and indeed the entire international Open Movement, has been aiming to, and will continue to liberate as much useful data as we can.  
      But are people able to use this data?
      Data literacy & data processing skills are critical to providing people with access to any data.  At OpenUp our theory of change is  ‘If people are given information about their situation, how change can be achieved and the means to do so, they will often take action to improve their lives”.  Part of providing information, is providing solutions to data literacy challenges.  Thus are people enabled to make informed decisions.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Why Storytelling?
    </div>
    <div class="anwer">
      We explore these decisions through the lens of storytelling.  Through the ages storytelling has been used to impart information.  The model of data-driven journalism provides the ethics, the framework, and the verification procedures necessary to do this authentically.
