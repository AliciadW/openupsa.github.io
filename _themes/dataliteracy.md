description: An understanding of data and its potential is needed to make effective use of it. Our goal is to create a society in which citizens can take a dataset, understand its significance for social change, and know how to use it to effect change.

Goals:
- Use of data to inform decision-making is not surprising or novel
- People are numerically literate
- Data literate media (journalists know how to calculate percentages)
- Data literacy/informed decision-making is taught at schools
- Those for whom data literacy is challenging (eg. due to physical disability) have effective support to be literate by proxy
- People produce and actively use data to convey arguments and make decisions
- Government can safely assume data literacy and presents governing challenges through the eyes of data
- People effectively use data to inform their day-to-day decision making
- Society can safely assume the government is data literate and can present and explain their issues to government through the eyes of data
