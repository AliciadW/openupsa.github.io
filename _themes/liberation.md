title: Data Liberation
order: 1
description: One of our most basic activities is to make data easily available and allow it to be engaged with by anyone, whether they are researchers, journalists, or interested citizens. Data liberation is not a goal in and of itself, but rather a stepping stone towards an empowered and informed citizenry.
