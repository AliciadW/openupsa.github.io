At the start of April, [OpenOwnership](http://openownership.org/) launched a pilot version of their new project, a beneficial ownership registry that has information about 1.9-million companies in the UK. The registry is freely and publicly available to anyone who wishes to find out about a company's beneficial owners, company links and other relevant information. 
Created by a consortium of organisations, it is part of the worlwide shift towards improved corporate transparency and accountability in the private sector, and is a very useful resource for researchers, journalists, investors, shareholders and the public. 

A beneficial owner is someone who enjoys the benefits of ownership even though they are not necessarily the legal owner of an entity, property or any sort of asset. In many cases, the legal and beneficial owners are one in the same and the concept of beneficial ownership is not in and of itself a bad thing. The problem instead comes in when there is a lack of transparency around who is actually benefitting from revenue, and when attempts are made to mask that from the public. This is often when illicit financial flow and questionable business practices are taking place.

OpenOwnership is, in partnerships with corporates, an attempt to change this and to start creating an environment in which civil society and the private sector are working together to more corporate openness
