    	<h3 id="welcome">Welcome to the data unit</h3>

    	<p>The skills that are necessary to commit responsible storytelling on data range between data processing, journalism, coding, and design.</p>

		<p>An ideal team of individuals, known as the data unit, who perform data storytelling, is composed of professionals such as data wranglers, storytellers, developers, editors and designers.</p>

		<p>Each member of the data unit possesses a different skillset. The data unit acts as a team, with individual strengths contributing to the overall output. The data unit is largely without hierarchy, and every member’s contribution is equally as important and necessary as any other member’s in order to complete the objectives set out by each stage of the data pipeline.</p>

		<p>Thus members must work together and collaborate in the decision-making processes in order to progress the storytelling.</p>

		<p>“There’s a digital revolution taking place both in and out of government in favor of open-sourced data, innovation, and collaboration.”</p>

		<p>- Kathleen Sebelius, Former United States Secretary of Health and Human Services</p>

		<h3 id="structure">The structure of the data unit</h3>

		<p>There may be many challenges an organisation or team will face in terms of a shortage of available or permanent resources, or capacity. Realistically, not every company, organisation, or individual will be able to establish a full-scale data unit.</p>

		<p>Yet there are many ways in which the data unit can be materialised in order to suit the resources available to the company, organisation, or individual. To help with this, there are two perspectives from which you can view the data unit. The perspective you choose is dependent on what best supports your current circumstance.</p>

		<p>The two perspectives for approaching the data unit are:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>A unit comprised of a team of experts such as the project manager, the data wrangler, the storyteller, the developer and/or the designer. This perspective is followed when an organisation, or collective of individuals, are able to support the costs and operation of a full-scale data unit.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Or, a collection of competencies or skills that make available the resources necessary to wrangle data, develop and design data visualisations, write responsible and authentic data stories, and manage data projects. This perspective is followed when the availability of funds, resources, and/or capacity is lacking.</li>
		</ol>


		<p>It is important to note that the size of the data unit does not prevent an individual, company or organisation from successfully telling stories with data.</p>

		<p>Data storytelling is made possible through investing in networks, connections and associations, leveraging resources and tapping into the existing online community, where you can always find a way to simulate or develop a particular skill or competency, or find someone who can help out with a task you may not be able to cover in-house.</p>

		<h3 id="structure-types">Two types of data units</h3>

		<h4 id="structure-individual">Jack of all trades</h4>

		<p>The jack of all trades is a lone ranger. From data sourcing to cleaning, analysis and visualisation. Alone, this one-man data unit completes every task along the data pipeline. And the <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/open-movement/">Open Movement</a> has a lot to do with the jack of all trades’ ability to do so.</p>

		<p>The <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/open-movement/">international drive towards ‘openness’</a> has not only made the sourcing of data much easier, but has also been the driving force behind the development of many of the tools that make the cleaning, processing and visualisation of data possible - without the need to be an expert in any single part of the process.</p>

		<p>Below are some examples of the way in which the data liberation has made it easier for the jack of all trades to work alone:</p>

          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h4 id="structure-large-scale">The large scale data unit</h4>

        <p>The large-scale data unit includes all the roles required for storytelling with data. Large-scale teams often have a long-term vision that includes opportunity for long form investigative stories, shorter projects as well as experimentation of methods and techniques.</p>

        <p>Thus this data unit is not solely focused on data storytelling but also dedicated to progressing or advancing the field of data storytelling, data liberation and open-source.</p>

        <p>You can see examples of large-scale data units at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/data">The Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.nacion.com/data/">La Nación</a> and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/">Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-15391515">BBC</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="roles-summary">Summary of roles and their competencies</h3>

        <p>The Data Unit is best understood by the different roles that need to be fulfilled. The typical roles that make up a data unit are: the project manager, the data wrangler, the storyteller, the developer and/or the designer.</p>

		<p>But what do they actually do? Let’s look at each role in light of their tasks and competencies.</p>

		<h4 id="pm">The Project Manager</h4>
