    	<h3 id="welcome">Welcome to the data unit</h3>

    	<p>The skills that are necessary to commit responsible storytelling on data range between data processing, journalism, coding, and design.</p>

		<p>An ideal team of individuals, known as the data unit, who perform data storytelling, is composed of professionals such as data wranglers, storytellers, developers, editors and designers.</p>

		<p>Each member of the data unit possesses a different skillset. The data unit acts as a team, with individual strengths contributing to the overall output. The data unit is largely without hierarchy, and every member’s contribution is equally as important and necessary as any other member’s in order to complete the objectives set out by each stage of the data pipeline.</p>

		<p>Thus members must work together and collaborate in the decision-making processes in order to progress the storytelling.</p>

		<p>“There’s a digital revolution taking place both in and out of government in favor of open-sourced data, innovation, and collaboration.”</p>

		<p>- Kathleen Sebelius, Former United States Secretary of Health and Human Services</p>

		<h3 id="structure">The structure of the data unit</h3>

		<p>There may be many challenges an organisation or team will face in terms of a shortage of available or permanent resources, or capacity. Realistically, not every company, organisation, or individual will be able to establish a full-scale data unit.</p>

		<p>Yet there are many ways in which the data unit can be materialised in order to suit the resources available to the company, organisation, or individual. To help with this, there are two perspectives from which you can view the data unit. The perspective you choose is dependent on what best supports your current circumstance.</p>

		<p>The two perspectives for approaching the data unit are:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>A unit comprised of a team of experts such as the project manager, the data wrangler, the storyteller, the developer and/or the designer. This perspective is followed when an organisation, or collective of individuals, are able to support the costs and operation of a full-scale data unit.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Or, a collection of competencies or skills that make available the resources necessary to wrangle data, develop and design data visualisations, write responsible and authentic data stories, and manage data projects. This perspective is followed when the availability of funds, resources, and/or capacity is lacking.</li>
		</ol>


		<p>It is important to note that the size of the data unit does not prevent an individual, company or organisation from successfully telling stories with data.</p>

		<p>Data storytelling is made possible through investing in networks, connections and associations, leveraging resources and tapping into the existing online community, where you can always find a way to simulate or develop a particular skill or competency, or find someone who can help out with a task you may not be able to cover in-house.</p>

		<h3 id="structure-types">Two types of data units</h3>

		<h4 id="structure-individual">Jack of all trades</h4>

		<p>The jack of all trades is a lone ranger. From data sourcing to cleaning, analysis and visualisation. Alone, this one-man data unit completes every task along the data pipeline. And the <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/open-movement/">Open Movement</a> has a lot to do with the jack of all trades’ ability to do so.</p>

		<p>The <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/open-movement/">international drive towards ‘openness’</a> has not only made the sourcing of data much easier, but has also been the driving force behind the development of many of the tools that make the cleaning, processing and visualisation of data possible - without the need to be an expert in any single part of the process.</p>

		<p>Below are some examples of the way in which the data liberation has made it easier for the jack of all trades to work alone:</p>

        </table>

        <h4 id="structure-large-scale">The large scale data unit</h4>

        <p>The large-scale data unit includes all the roles required for storytelling with data. Large-scale teams often have a long-term vision that includes opportunity for long form investigative stories, shorter projects as well as experimentation of methods and techniques.</p>

        <p>Thus this data unit is not solely focused on data storytelling but also dedicated to progressing or advancing the field of data storytelling, data liberation and open-source.</p>

        <p>You can see examples of large-scale data units at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/data">The Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.nacion.com/data/">La Nación</a> and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/">Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-15391515">BBC</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="roles-summary">Summary of roles and their competencies</h3>

        <p>The Data Unit is best understood by the different roles that need to be fulfilled. The typical roles that make up a data unit are: the project manager, the data wrangler, the storyteller, the developer and/or the designer.</p>

		<p>But what do they actually do? Let’s look at each role in light of their tasks and competencies.</p>

		<h4 id="pm">The Project Manager</h4>

		<p>The project manager oversees the management of the complete process from ideation to publication and distribution.</p>

		<h5 id="pm-tasks">Tasks at a glance</h5>

		</ul>

		<h4 id="dw">The Data Wrangler</h4>

		<p>Data wrangling is the most impactful step in the data pipeline.</p>

		<p>This is because every other role within the unit is, to a significant degree, dependent on the output of the data wrangler in order to move ahead.</p>

		<h5 id="dw-tasks">Tasks at a glance</h5>

		<ul>
			<li>Data wranglers are responsible for sourcing the data, understanding the data, cleaning the data, and conducting analysis on the data.</li>
			<li>Data wranglers conduct initial and exploratory analysis on the data that helps to determine its contents and limitations.</li>
			<li>Data wranglers guide other members in the interpretation and the presentation of the data.</li>
			<li>Data wranglers are responsible for distributing data samples (and insights) to other members of the team, thus allowing them to progress in their respective tasks.</li>
			<li>The data wrangler must also consider different ways in which the data could be shaped, and how these different categorisations can find different ‘stories’ in the data.</li>
			<li>The data wrangler, in conjunction with the journalist, should probe the data from a journalistic perspective, by asking investigative questions, to identify the ways in which the data can be connected to something of human interest.</li>

			<li>Experience working with Open Source technologies</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 id="storyteller">The Storyteller</h4>

		<p>The storyteller conducts the journalism on the numbers. The role of the storyteller is not only to dig around in the data to find the stories, but to go out into the world to see if those stories hold true i.e. conduct reporting on the data.</p>

		<p>Remember the numbers are not the story, just the source of the story. The storyteller will still have to go out, report on it, and weave together a story that best captures the message.</p>

		<h5 id="st-tasks">Tasks at a glance</h5>

		<ul>
			<li>The storyteller has to conduct adequate research surrounding the topic that governs the dataset in order to understand the value it holds, the limitations that apply,  and to formulate relevant questions that the data will try to answer.</li>
			<li>Based on the shared pool of knowledge that exists between the data wranglers experience of working with the dataset/s and the storytellers research, pre-existing insight into the topic, and the overarching objective of the project, they will sit in discussion and formulate a single or series of core questions that will define the story angles.</li>
			<li>The storyteller must interview the data and first seek to answer six basic journalistic inquiries: who, what, when, where, why, and how. This will help the storyteller build context and position the data within their knowledge regarding the topic at hand.</li>
			<li>The storyteller is responsible for developing the story map. In this session, the storyteller, the project manager and the developer/designer work hand-in-hand with defining the presentation, or packaging, and delivery of the story.</li>
			<li>The storyteller prepares all written content for the project, while upholding ethics and standards for reporting on, and writing about certain topics.</li>
		</ul>

			<li>Sometimes, data storytellers will be expected to be able to create their own graphics, in order to allow specialised designer/developers to concentrate on more ambitious visualisations</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 id="dev">The Developer (and/or Designer)</h4>

		<p>Data storytelling, often digitally-driven, presents the need for the inclusion of a developer in the unit who assists with the technical elements of the project. These technical elements can take on the form of data visualisations, storytelling templates, data-driven tools and web applications.</p>

		<p>Ideally, the developer in this case should also possess a basic understanding and basic working proficiency in visual communication and design.</p>

		<h5 id="dev-tasks">Tasks at a glance</h5>

		<ul>
			<li>The developer is responsible for producing data visualisations, cartography, and infographics while ensuring the best representation of data in all formats (digital and print).</li>
			<li>The developer is responsible for building a framework that supports all elements of the story.</li>
			<li>The developer must ensure that the highest (and most up to date) standards are upheld in the process of developing online resources.</li>
			<li>The developer is responsible for resolving issues related to publishing, embedding, and distributing these graphics.</li>

		</ul>

		<h3 id="workflow-collaboration">Workflows and collaboration</h3>

		<p>Collaboration is defined as the action of working with someone to produce something and the success of the data unit is dependent on each member’s ability to work collaboratively.</p>

		<p>But what does it mean to collaborate? And how far does this collaboration extend into the workflow of each of the individual roles making up the data unit?</p>

		<p>In order to collaborate effectively as a member of the data unit, or merely to context-switch between skills when working alone, there are a few things you need to consider before getting started:</p>

		<h4 id="understanding">Understanding</h4>

		<p>It is critical that each member of the data unit understands something of the function of the others. Without this understanding, as a member of the data unit, you will be unaware of what each member needs from you and when they need it, or when you will receive what you need from the others.</p>

		<h4 id="workflow">Workflow</h4>

		<p>Different technical skills follow different processes and need to uphold different standards in the fulfilment of their tasks. The workflow for each member in the completion of their objective is different and it may be some time before they are able to deliver the output that another member requires in order to move forward.</p>

		<h4 id="Collaboration">Collaboration</h4>

		<p>Almost all decision-making during the course of the project is done collaboratively. The expertise of every member in collaboration with other members is needed to progress and shape the project. Often, the work of one member is prepared and completed to suit the needs and requirements of the member (or competency) to follow. And this informs the fundamental mode for collaboration.</p>

		<h3 id="mapping-collaboration">The unit in action: mapping collaboration along the data  storytelling pipeline</h3>

		<p>What does collaboration look like and what process does it follow?</p>

		<h4 id="getting-started">It begins with the team</h4>

		<p>The project manager is assigned to a project, in this instance the project is a data-driven story. The project manager then assembles a team together. This team is made up of a data wrangler, a storyteller, a developer/designer, and of course, the project manager.</p>

		<p>The project is introduced to the team. The team members, while leveraging their collective expertise, shape the agenda of the project, determine a timeline that works in conjunction with an estimation of assumed tasks and knowledge of individual workflows, as well as bearing in mind the scale of the project itself.</p>

		<p>Once the agenda has been set, the project manager is responsible for allocating resources and capacity (human and other), as well as acquiring that which is not available internally, in order to see the fulfillment of the project at hand.</p>
