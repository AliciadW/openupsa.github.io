          <h3>Package and Present Data for Storytelling</h3>

          <p>Learn to tell compelling narratives by transforming your data into information and stories that make sense and matter to your audience.</p>

          <p>Understanding numbers and sets of detailed information isn’t easy for everyone, let alone when you’re trying to use that information to tell a story. Anyone who works with data needs to know how to effectively package and present it in ways that make the most sense. Data visualisation is so much more than just charts, graphs and numerical analysis; it is one of the most powerful forms of storytelling. In a time where misinformation and disinformation is everywhere, having the facts to strengthen your story is more important than ever.</p>
          <p>We will cover data storytelling, visualisation, and packaging and presentation – helping you transform your analysis to improve your data storytelling and tell narratives that matter.</p>
