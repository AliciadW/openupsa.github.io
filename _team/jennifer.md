biography:

- highlight: Spent 4 years paying my dues as a middleware developer at Woolworths before the need to understand all the things took me down the business analysis path
- highlight: I spent the next 10 years playing a multitude of roles ranging from business analyst, project manager, product owner and product manager for organisations such as Global Vision, CareerJunction, Yola.com and MrD
statement: I’m deeply passionate about our planet and environment, and believe that we are merely custodians of this rock with no real right to entitlement. When I’m not daydreaming about a human extinction event, I like to help people realise their potential and show them how to potentially make a difference in another’s life - sometimes just by sharing their story.<br>After 14 years in the commercial sector, the desire to make a difference had me actively searching for opportunities to fuel my soul. I wanted to use my skills in a socially responsible manner, and not merely to maximise profits (seemingly at all costs). Then I met Adi Eyal during a freelance stint and had a glimpse of what meaningful work could be like. This became my reality in 2015 when I joined OpenUp. Honesty, integrity and trust sit high on my list of must-have values, and I am grateful to work with an organisation that feels the same. 
fun:
- fact: "Choose a movie title for the story of your life. Serendipity"
- fact: "What is the oldest thing in your refrigerator? Pickled lemons...I’m still waiting for that Moroccan inspiration to hit me."
