- highlight: Worked with the Ghana Statistical Service to release the Multi Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2011 while at UNICEF
- highlight: Processed the visa applications for Julius Caesar and Eric Cantona while working at the Dutch Embassy in Jakarta (last names aren't used in some parts of Indonesia so when parents register their kids they can get creative and make something up)
statement: I live my life as if I believe in reincarnation, where every living being starts a new life in a random physical body or form after they die. I think that if everyone believed this, they would put in more effort to make the world a more pleasant and equal place. I think OpenUp's mission of creating a more informed and empowered society aligns with this (the equality part, the reincarnation not so much). After my studies I enquired about a possible internship at the organisation. A few weeks later I arrived in Cape Town to join the team and later joined on a permanent basis.
fun:
- fact: What is the oldest thing in your refrigerator? The light bulb. It's been broken for at least three years.
