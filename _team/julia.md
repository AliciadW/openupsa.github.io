statement: Iâ€™m passionate about geographic data - so much of what happens around us is based on geography, and using geography to highlight trends & patterns is a valuable tool in the analyst's toolbelt. Seventeen years of working in GIS for Media Sales left me with a passion for data and a data wrangling skill set, but I found working in the corporate sector disillusioning. I was constantly on the lookout for  opportunities to use my skills for the greater good. Synchronicity and serendipity led me to leave Johannesburg with my son, move to Stellenbosch, and start working with OpenUp. Here, I contributed to various exciting and inspiring projects like <a href="http://ismaps.org.za/">ismaps</a>, <a href="http://vote4thebudget.org">vote4thebudget</a> and <a href="http://code4sa.org/taxclock/">Tax Clock</a>, as well as training and mentoring in various data literacy programmes.

- fact: "What is the older thing in your refrigerator? Rennet is an ingredient used to make to make cheese, which you keep in the freezer. An old housemate left it behind when he moved out."
