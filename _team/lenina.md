statement: "I believe that access to information changes lives. Not just high-profile government information or secrets, but basic information like how to write a CV, or who to call to fix a municipal problem. We need information to live decent lives, but currently, the knowledge landscape mirrors our food crisis. Here’s the thing: unlike food, information is everywhere, but most of it is in a form that people can’t understand, access or use.<br>This is why our work at OpenUp is so important. It goes beyond just making information available, but making it accessible, understandable, searchable and free."
