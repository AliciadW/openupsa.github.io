statement: I'm most passionate about showing people how data, even very boring data, gives a really interesting and informative view of society. My professional bio speaks about working for the 'data dark side', where I worked commercially extracting information from the internet to help the marketing companies sell the usual evil stuff. Then I realised that I have the skills to do much more valuable work. The first project was access to medicines in Northern Africa, and what grew out of there was seeing that data is a very powerful tool, much more so than people realise. As an organisation, I believe that OpenUp is testing boundaries. We are the first ones in this space, and we don't know how things are done, but we are challenging ourselves and challenging the world to do things that no one else has done before.
fun:
