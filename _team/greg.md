statement: "I believe that building a successful, equal society means understanding your role, rights and responsibilities as a citizen. I first got involved with civic technology when I wondered how by-laws worked, then started exploring how to use my skills to help South Africa. I was contracted by OpenUp to build wazimap.co.za in 2013, and then joined full time as Head of Technology soon afterwards. Iâ€™m incredibly lucky to be alive at a time when my skills and interests are in demand and can have an impact on society."
