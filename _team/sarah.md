statement: "I’m most passionate about music, pasta and evidence-driven journalism. I believe that information should be open; that the foundation of any free and democratic society is the free flow of ideas. Which largely explains my background in legal and investigative reporting. I came across OpenUp through my work in data journalism, and when the position opened up for a news editor at the Code4SA Data Journalism Academy, I applied. I’ve since found myself knee-deep in other fascinating projects, and am currently working on freeing corporate data"
fun:
- fact: "My special skill is: Music. I studied classical and jazz piano and trombone during my brief, sordid flirtation with academia. So, I basically specialise in snobbery. I'm a recovering classical pianist."
- fact: "What is the oldest thing in your refrigerator? A box of cheap wine. There's a drop left and while I can't drink it, I'm convinced I'll need it one day and I can't get rid of it."
