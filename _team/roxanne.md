full-name: Roxanne Joseph
name: roxanne
position: Corporate Data Researcher
current: currently working on
email: roxanne@openup.org.za
facilitator: true
biography:
- highlight: In my previous life I worked in education activism and research, where I spent a lot of time marching, mobilising and learning how it's done from the youth
- highlight: BA at UCT, where I did a triple major in subjects completely unrelated to anything I do now, then Journalism at Wits, where I worked in the Wits Vuvuzela newsroom
- highlight: Worked in several newsrooms (eNCA and Bloomberg) and freelanced for several news organisations, including Al Jazeera, where I did a lot of reporting around the xenophobic attacks in 2015
statement: I believe in equality, across all spheres, borders and lines and in every way possible. My focus is on playing a small role in building an informed and empowered society, which is what OpenUp is about. I came across the organisation during a project on textbook monitoring in Limpopo, followed by some election analysis and reporting last year. And now Iâ€™m part of the furniture. <br> My side passion is photography. I love being able to visualise my perception of the things around me, and compare it to what other people see and experience, while simultaneously feeding my Instagram addiction.
fun:
- fact: "What is the oldest thing in your refrigerator? I have a tiny bottle of champagne from my 21st. I just can't let go of what it felt like to be young."
