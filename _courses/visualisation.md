Visualising data is one of the final ways in which we package data for communication. To do this effectively we need a clear understanding of which portion of our data tells or enriches our story, understanding what our audience requires in order to interpret or access the information in our visualisation and how to translate that understanding into our visualisation through wielding basic design elements such as colour, type and composition.

This course presents a comprehensive introduction to visualising your data for the purposes of storytelling by focusing on the creation and integration of data visualisations in the form of interactive charts and graphs, infographics and maps suitable for use in both print and digital environments.
