Open data initiatives and data literacy have become increasingly important as the digital age opens up new ways for people to access and interrogate information. Convergence between government, academia, media and technology means that these data driven pursuits can be used for the benefit of society. As a result, data driven storytelling plays a pivotal role in communicating the fruits of this convergence across the globe.

This course presents a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of data journalism as a method for practicing storytelling with data.

It walks participants through what data is, who works with data in a newsroom and how they do it, setting up a data unit to fit into an existing newsroom, as well as providing participants with a blueprint to follow in order to effectively process data to prepare it for storytelling, in the form of the data pipeline.
