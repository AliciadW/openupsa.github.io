In today’s world, information is being transformed into data. A key ability for a data storyteller is to be able to find, extract and transform relevant data into machine readable format. Sourcing and scraping data is the very first step of any data process, or the Data Pipeline. Once relevant data has been sourced and extracted into machine readable format, it can then be cleaned and then analysed.
