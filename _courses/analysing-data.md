In todayâ€™s world, information is being transformed into data. Journalists need to understand how to analyse this data in order to discover new issues, gain a better understanding of the reality, and to be able to verify facts from sources.

This brings power to accountability, where data is the common language and will disclose any information that is hidden. A spreadsheet forms the knowledge base that provides the springboard for those wishing to tell stories using data into the world of data analysis.
