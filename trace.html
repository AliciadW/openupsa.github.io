				<p>Our mission is simple: To make corporate data freely and publically available, and to empower you to hold the right people in the corporate sector accountable when they do things that affect your everyday life.</p><p>We believe you shouldn't have to pay for company information that should legally and legitimately be public.</p><p>Data Desk is a place where you can ask us to help you find information about corporates that affects you. We want to help you find it.</p>


				<p class="service-subhead">What is corporate data?</p>
				<p>We've defined corporate data in four ways, although we’d love to hear from you if there’s more we should be looking for.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Corporate structure. (i.e. corporate ownership, activity, key actors)</li>
					<li>The relationship between the company and the state (i.e. tender information, ownership, potential conflicts of interest)</li>
					<li>The relationship between the company and its shareholders (i.e. shareholder structure, reported information, financial information)</li>
					<li>The relationship between the company and communities (i.e. environmental impact, social responsibility, fair business practises.</li>
				</ul>
